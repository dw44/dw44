Hi, Iâ€™m Tanzeel, a self taught developer with a background in engineering. I was first exposed to code at university where I learnt C++, Motorola Assembly, and MATLAB. I didn't discover my flair for it until much later when, through sheer chance, I had to use VBA scripts to automate some serious data processing in Microsoft Excel of all places, so not the most traditional second "first experience" for a web developer.

I have since learnt to program in Python and JavaScript, focusing on web application development using the MERN stack. I particularly enjoy working with the React ecosystem, having spent most of the last two years working with the MERN stack on personal projects. I've briefly dabbled with PostgreSQL and continuing my experimentation with SQL, I'm currently tinkering with MySQL as I move to an SQL database as the primary database for my projects.
