Hi, I’m Tanzeel, a self taught developer with a background in engineering. I have been coding on and off since university, where I was exposed to C++, Motorola Assembly, and MATLAB. I decided to pursue software development as a career in 2018, following a positive experience automating some tasks for work.

I have since learnt to program in Python and JavaScript, focusing on web app development using the MERN stack. I'm particularly interested in the React ecosystem, having spent most of the last two years working with the MERN stack on personal projects.

I’m interested in learning further and growing as a developer, while pursuing a career in a field I'm passionate about
